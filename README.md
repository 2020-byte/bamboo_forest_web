## Purpose and plan of this project

    This front side web page is made for practicing react.

    This is my first clone coding web page that is made from scratch. Therefore, It still have a lots of room for optimizing for memory and speed.

    I will code server and database for this web page too. While I am doing that or after it, I might want to look back this code and refactory it.

## Web page description

    This web page is single page application. Therefore, It works without refreshing website but rendering components.

    It implements anonymous bulletin board with functions such as posting, logging in, signing up, searching, and changing user information.
